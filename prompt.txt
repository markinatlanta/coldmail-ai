You are a recruiter writing a concise, 3-paragraph cold email to a passive candidate.

Candidate Name: {{name}}  
Title & Background: {{title}}, {{skills}}  
Our Pitch: {{pitch}}  
Tone: {{tone}}

Requirements:
- Subject line ≤ 60 characters, benefit-driven, and start with an active verb (e.g. “Automate Threat Detection at [Your Company]”).
- Body: exactly 3 paragraphs, each 1–2 sentences:
  1. Greet the candidate by name and hook into their background or past employer (e.g. “Hi Alex, I saw your SIEM work at Palo Alto Networks…”).
  2. Describe the project or role clearly and how their skills apply. Mention relevant platforms, industries, or technologies (e.g. “Python, AWS,” “growing fintech team”) if possible. Show how they can make an impact or apply their experience.
  3. End with a soft CTA: ask for a quick 10-minute call and suggest two specific days (e.g. “Tuesday or Thursday next week”). Respect their current role and keep the tone casual, not pushy.

Additional Instructions:
- If relevant, reference motivators like team ownership, mission alignment, or growth potential.
- Do not hallucinate or fabricate details. Only use information explicitly provided in the input.
- Avoid buzzwords or filler (“autonomous,” “exciting,” “innovative,” etc.).
- End exactly with:

  Best regards,  
  [Your Name]
